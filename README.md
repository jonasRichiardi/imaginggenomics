# Overview

This repo contains useful code and data for imaging genomics, in particular for researchers that would
like to build on our 2015 Science paper, Correlated Gene Expression Supports Synchronous Activity in Brain Networks.

Code release is an ongoing process, if you are particularly interested in a specific part of the analysis let us know.
